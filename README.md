# README.md for DNN_Dino Repository

## Overview
This repository implements a DINO (Distillation of Self-Supervised Learning) model, focusing on self-supervised learning techniques for computer vision. It's based on Vision Transformers (ViT) and includes custom neural network architectures and data augmentation strategies.

## Main Components
- `DataAugmentation.py`: Implements data augmentation methods for neural network training.
- `Trainer.py`: Manages model training, including setup and execution.
- `eval.py`: Evaluates the model using K-Nearest Neighbors classification accuracy.
- `train.py`: Main script to configure and start the training process.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions and classes for model training.
- `models/DINO.py`: Contains the DINO model implementation.
- `models/ViT.py`: Implementation of Vision Transformer with custom layers.
- `configs`: YAML configuration files for setting up models and datasets.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for testing and demonstration.

## Training and Usage
To train the DINO model:
1. Set up your environment and install required dependencies.
2. Configure your model and dataset paths in the YAML files in the `configs` folder.
3. Run `train.py` with the desired configuration file.

For a detailed guide, refer to the notebooks which provide step-by-step instructions and examples.
